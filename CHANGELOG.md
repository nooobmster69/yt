This file documents all notable changes to the YouTube Audiobook Script Generator application.

## Session: 29 Jul 2025 - Feature Expansion & Optimization

This major update introduces a powerful AI Style Suggestion engine, fixes a key bug, and implements significant performance and code quality optimizations across the application.

### New Features & Enhancements
- **Feature: Dual-Mode AI Narrative Style Suggestion (Now Fully Functional)**
  - **Change:** The "Core Idea" section now features two powerful AI suggestion modes to guide creative direction. The underlying logic has been fixed, making the feature fully operational.
  - **Details:**
    - **Suggest from Existing Styles:** The AI analyzes your topic and recommends a complete narrative package (Script Style, Creative Angle, Story Focus, and Welcome Style) from the existing options, along with a detailed rationale for its choices.
    - **Suggest a *Brand New* Style:** The AI invents a *completely new, custom-tailored narrative DNA* for your video, generating unique names and descriptions for a new Script Style, Creative Angle, and Welcome Style. Applying this cleverly embeds it into your Topic Guide as a creative brief.

### Bug Fixes
- **Bug Fix: "Apply Suggestion" Button**
  - **Change:** Fixed a critical syntax error that prevented the "Apply Suggestion" buttons from functioning.
  - **Details:** Corrected invalid `try...catch` blocks in the application's main component, which was preventing state updates. Applying a suggestion now correctly updates all relevant settings in the form, and the changes are reflected instantly.

### Performance & Code Quality
- **Performance: Application Rendering Optimization**
  - **Change:** Significantly improved UI responsiveness by preventing unnecessary re-renders.
  - **Details:** Memoized the main `GeneratorForm` and `ResultDisplay` components. The `Overview` tab within the results area was also optimized for more efficient rendering.
- **Cleanup: Project Files**
  - **Change:** Streamlined the project by removing an import for a deprecated component.

## Session: 28 Jul 2025 - AI Prompt & Persona Enhancement

This update focuses on a deep optimization of the AI's core writing instructions to enhance realism and effectiveness across different content styles.

### Feature-Specific Improvements

- **Feature: `Script Style` > `YouTuber Explainer`**
  - **Change:** The AI's core persona for this style has been rewritten to be more energetic and direct.
  - **Details:** It is now explicitly instructed to use shorter, punchier sentences, ask rhetorical questions to the viewer, and adopt the persona of an enthusiastic friend sharing mind-blowing information. This is designed to produce a more authentic script with higher audience retention.

- **Feature: `Script Style` > `Narrative` & `Creative Story` (for Sleep Content)**
  - **Change:** Optimized the AI's instructions for creating calming, hypnotic audio experiences, perfect for sleep videos.
  - **Details:** The prompt now guides the AI to use long, flowing, melodic sentences, employ soft sounds (sibilance), and strictly avoid any startling or abrupt language to create a smooth, relaxing listening experience.

- **Feature: `Welcome Style` Prompts**
  - **Change:** Both `Energetic` and `Calm` welcome script prompts have been significantly enhanced for greater impact.
  - **Details for `Energetic Welcome`:** The prompt now focuses on creating a powerful curiosity gap in the first 10 seconds, using psychologically-proven "cold open" techniques.
  - **Details for `Calm Welcome`:** The prompt now guides the AI to create a "sanctuary" for the listener, giving them explicit permission to fall asleep and making the introduction part of the relaxation process itself.

- **Feature: Core Writing Engine (`generationService`)**
  - **Change:** A new "Adaptive Writing Techniques" module has been added to the core generation prompts.
  - **Details:** The AI is now context-aware and will adapt its sentence structure based on the chosen script style. It prioritizes short, punchy sentences for energetic content (`YouTuber Explainer`) and long, flowing sentences for calm narratives (`Narrative`), ensuring the writing style always matches the creative intent.

## Current Application Status & Feature Breakdown

This section provides a high-level overview of all features currently implemented in the application.

### Core Generation Engine
*   **Dual Generation Workflows**:
    *   **Chapter-Driven (Recommended)**: The AI first generates a full chapter outline for a structured script, showing live progress as it writes each section. Ideal for long-form, organized content.
    *   **Extended Generation**: The AI writes a continuous, free-flowing script, perfect for creative narratives where a rigid structure isn't needed.
*   **Multiple Script Styles**: You can choose from a variety of writing styles, including **Narrative Storyteller**, **YouTuber Explainer**, **Creative Story**, formal **Documentary**, conversational **Podcast** (both solo and two-host), and more.
*   **Deep Creative Control**: You can guide the narrative with settings like **Creative Angle** (e.g., "Plot Twist," "Fun & Witty"), **Story Focus** (personal vs. general), and a specific **Welcome Style** for the video's introduction.
*   **Factual Grounding**: An option to use **Google Search** to ground the script in up-to-date, factual information. When used, it automatically provides a "Sources" tab with all referenced links for easy fact-checking.

### Visuals & Pre-Production
*   **AI Thumbnail Concepts**: The AI generates three distinct, high-impact thumbnail concepts based on your video's topic, following strategies used by popular YouTubers.
*   **Interactive Thumbnail Builder**: A visual, drag-and-drop canvas where you can arrange text and object placeholders. The application then translates your visual layout into a detailed, ready-to-use AI image prompt.
*   **Extensive Image Style Library**: A rich, searchable library of dozens of pre-defined art styles (e.g., "Gritty Historical Comic," "Ultra-Real Cinematic," "Ghibli-esque Watercolor") that can be combined with your scene descriptions to create final image prompts. Styles can be edited and customized.
*   **In-App Image Generation**: You can generate images directly from your prompts within the app using Imagen models, including a feature to make AI-powered adjustments to existing images.

### Post-Production Tools
*   **Director Mode & Cues**: Automatically inserts visual cues (`[CUE:X]`) into the script and generates corresponding image prompts, creating an instant shot list.
*   **Automatic YouTube Chapters**: The AI analyzes the final script to generate timestamped chapter markers that you can copy directly into your YouTube description.
*   **AI-Generated Editing Timeline**: Creates a complete editing plan with suggestions for visuals, text overlays, and sound/music cues, all timestamped to the script.
*   **SSML Generation**: For any part of the script, you can generate professional-grade SSML (Speech Synthesis Markup Language) for use in advanced text-to-speech engines.

### Project Management & UI/UX
*   **Save/Load Projects**: You can save your entire session—including all settings and generated content—to a single `.json` file and load it back in later to continue your work.
*   **Presets**: Quickly apply pre-configured settings for common video types like "Deep Dive Science Doc" or "Creative Fictional Story" to get started faster.
*   **Multiple Export Options**: The entire project can be exported as a well-formatted **Microsoft Word (.docx)** file or as a self-contained, interactive **HTML file** with navigation and a dark mode toggle.
*   **Edit Mode**: A toggle that allows you to directly edit any AI-generated text, from the main summary and tags to individual image prompts, giving you full control over the final output.
*   **Help & Debugging**: Includes a "What's New" modal to track updates, a comprehensive "User Guide" that explains every feature, and an "AI Log Viewer" for inspecting API calls.
